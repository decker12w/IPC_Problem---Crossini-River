#5.6 Building H2O 
This problem has been a staple of the Operating Systems class at U.C. 
Berkeley for at least a decade. It seems to be based on an exercise in Andrews’s Concurrent Programming [1]. 
There are two kinds of threads, oxygen and hydrogen. In order to assemble these threads into water molecules, we have to create a barrier that makes each thread wait until a complete molecule is ready to proceed. As each thread passes the barrier, it should invoke bond. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule invoke bond before any of the threads from the next molecule do. In other words: • If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads. • If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread. We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that invoke bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads. 
Puzzle: Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

##5.6.1 H2O hint
Variáveis usadasa
mutex = Semaphore(1) 
oxygen = 0 
hydrogen = 0
barrier = Barrier(3)
oxyQueue = Semaphore(0)
hydroQueue = Semaphore(0)
oxygen and hydrogen are counters, protected by mutex. 
Barrier is where each set of three threads meets after invoking bond and before allowing the next set of threads to proceed. oxyQueue is the semaphore oxygen threads wait on; hydroQueue is the semaphore hydrogen threads wait on. 
I am using the naming convention for queues, so oxyQueue.wait() means “join the oxygen queue” and oxyQueue.signal() means “release an oxygen thread from the queue.”

##5.6.2 H2O solution
Initially hydroQueue and oxyQueue are locked. When an oxygen thread arrives it signals hydroQueue twice, allowing two hydrogens to proceed. Then the oxygen thread waits for the hydrogen threads to arrive.

###Oxygen Code
mutex.wait() 
  oxygen += 1 
  if hydrogen >= 2: 
    hydroQueue.signal(2) 
    hydrogen-= 2 
    oxyQueue.signal() 
    oxygen-= 1 
  else: 
    mutex.signal() 
  oxyQueue.wait() 
  bond() 
  barrier.wait() 
  mutex.signal()


###Hydrogen Code
mutex.wait() 
  hydrogen += 1 
  if hydrogen >= 2 and oxygen >= 1: 
    hydroQueue.signal(2) 
    hydrogen-= 2 
    oxyQueue.signal() 
    oxygen-= 1 
  else: 
    mutex.signal() 
  hydroQueue.wait() 
  bond() 
  barrier.wait()

  An unusual feature of this solution is that the exit point of the mutex is ambiguous. In some cases, threads enter the mutex, update the counter, and exit the mutex. But when a thread arrives that forms a complete set, it has to keep the mutex in order to bar subsequent threads until the current set have invoked bond. 
  After invoking bond, the three threads wait at a barrier. When the barrier opens, we know that all three threads have invoked bond and that one of them holds the mutex. We don’t know which thread holds the mutex, but it doesn’t matter as long as only one of them releases it. Since we know there is only one oxygen thread, we make it do the work. 
  This might seem wrong, because until now it has generally been true that a thread has to hold a lock in order to release it. But there is no rule that says that has to be true. This is one of those cases where it can be misleading to think of a mutex as a token that threads acquire and release.
